This is a basic project that reads data from a text file and shows some functionalities.

1) To run the program the runners.txt must be locate in the same file as the runners_program.py.
I recommend to open the full file to run in a editor.

2) Instructions on this program are very basics. Just follow the instructions on the comand line

Thanks!
